## ✨ Popular linux distributions configured with systemd, sshd, ttyd and commontools ✨

Popular linux distributions with systemd, sshd, ttyd and commontools.  Superb for use with Docker 🐋

## Overview

Unlike the two images that these build on ([spurin/container-systemd](https://github.com/spurin/container-systemd) and [spurin/container-systemd-sshd-ttyd](https://github.com/spurin/container-systemd-sshd-ttyd)), these are somewhat opinionated by myself.

As I've used these for the creation of labs, I treat this layer as a base for commontools that I expect to be used by most, hence the likes of vim, nano and others.

Merge requests with 'opinionated' additions are likely to be rejected, instead I encourage you to fork and use this as required 😎

See the individual branches for sources.
